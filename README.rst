My Portfolio
============

This repository serves as a curated portfolio of my data analytics projects, encompassing a variety of analyses, business cases, and exploratory data studies. Here, you’ll find both personal and work-related projects that highlight my skills in data wrangling, statistical modeling, visualization, and business intelligence.

Each project includes a brief overview and description, the tools and techniques used (such as Python, SQL, Excel, Power BI, or Tableau), and links to datasets and detailed documentation.

This repository and all projects within it were created by Stefano Gonan, PhD.

Bottling Line Efficiency Rescue: Downtime Reduction Strategy
############################################################

**Overview**:  
Analyzed manufacturing line productivity data to identify downtime factors, operator efficiency, and process bottlenecks. Built visualizations, pivot tables, and Pareto charts to highlight key inefficiencies and suggest improvements.

**Description**:  
In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis of manufacturing line productivity data to assess the efficiency of operators and identify root causes of downtime in production batches. In particular, I calculated the average efficiency of each operator in order to identify the least productive ones. I also performed a Pareto analysis to determine the factors responsible for 80% of the reduction in efficiency. This allowed me to analyse the downtime of each operator in relation to the previously identified factors, enabling me to create a targeted programme to improve the efficiency of individual operators in areas where they are less efficient.

**Tools**: Microsoft Excel

**Skills**:  
Pareto Analysis | Root Cause Diagnostics | Downtime Reduction Strategy | Preventive Maintenance Planning | KPI Tracking

The 41,000-Foot View: Decoding Airlines Passengers Satisfaction
###############################################################

**Overview**:  
Transformed 41,000+ Skytrax passenger reviews into an interactive Tableau dashboard for British Airways, identifying critical improvement areas across 8 service categories and 7 global regions.

**Description**:  
I developed a business intelligence dashboard analyzing 41,000+ passenger reviews from 100+ airlines to empower them with actionable customer experience insights. In particular, the interactive visualisation—based on the Skytrax Airline Reviews dataset—tracks satisfaction trends for a period of time ranging from 1970 to 2015 across 8 service categories—including cabin staff, seat comfort, and inflight entertainment—using dynamic filters for airline company, traveller type (e.g. business, leisure), seat type (e.g. economy, business, first class), and geographic regions.

**Tools**:  
Tableau  

**Skills**:  
Dashboard Design | Trend Analysis | Customer Experience Metrics | KPI Tracking | Interactive Data Storytelling
